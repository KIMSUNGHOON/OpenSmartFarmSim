# Internal web shell

The current screen submits registered synthetic location research and reads
its real server job/hold status. The third screen lists exact stored economic
assumptions, registers a numeric revision and admits/reads a selected conditional
ledger calculation, including a manually requested monthly cash table. Full
farm input, baseline/event/settlement authoring, break-even plan/trial forms,
map, replay and production hosting are pending. See the
[location contract](../contracts/web-location-shell-v1.md) and
[economic contract](../contracts/web-economic-workspace-v1.md).

## Software checks

Use Node `22.22.3` and npm `11.16.0`:

```bash
npm ci --strict-peer-deps
npm run typecheck
npm run test
npm run build
npx --no-install playwright install chromium
npm run test:browser
```

Run from `web/`. The browser suite starts its own loopback server on 5173 and
refuses to reuse an existing service. Browser responses in that suite are
explicit test doubles, not completed product CLI work. CI runs these checks
with pinned actions/tools and `npm audit --audit-level=high`.

## Connect an operator-assembled API

Supply absolute paths to protected TLS files outside the web source/build
directory. The API must already be assembled using the
[runtime contract](../contracts/api-runtime-assembly-v1.md) and its authenticated
server-owned registry. The browser must trust the browser-facing certificate.
For an internal deployment using a private CA, point the upstream CA setting
to its public certificate; TLS verification stays enabled.

```bash
OSSF_WEB_API_ORIGIN='https://127.0.0.1:8443' \
OSSF_WEB_API_CA='/protected/api-ca.pem' \
OSSF_WEB_TLS_CERT='/protected/web-cert.pem' \
OSSF_WEB_TLS_KEY='/protected/web-key.pem' \
npm run dev
```

Open `https://127.0.0.1:5173`, expand **내부 시험 연결**, and enter the
operator-issued token in the page. Never place the token in a URL, command,
environment file, repository or screenshot. The token remains in page memory.
The server must register the exact tenant, coordinate, UTC period and goal;
the example button does not register or approve a source. `npm run preview`
serves only the static build and has no API proxy.

## Real local integration

After locked backend installation and Chromium installation, set
`OSSF_TEST_PG_DSN` through a protected local test configuration and run from
`backend/`:

```bash
uv run --locked --group dev pytest -q -s tests/web_shell_smoke.py tests/web_economic_smoke.py
```

This explicit smoke creates disposable SCRAM roles, an actual API, Vite HTTPS
proxy and an isolated Chromium context. It checks queued admission, persisted
fake-CLI hold, repeated intent with one stored job and rejection of an
untrusted upstream certificate. Only the isolated synthetic browser fixture
ignores its ephemeral browser-facing certificate error; the upstream and
Python HTTPS checks verify certificates. Services and temporary database password files
are cleaned up. The economic smoke also checks an exact decimal revision, actual scenario and
calculation admission, worker completion, result and monthly cash display, and identical retry
with one stored calculation job. Its data/keys are self-authored synthetic
fixtures, and it invokes no CLI. These smokes are not yet part of hosted web CI
or full G1. [Evidence](../research/web-economic-workspace-implementation.md)
records the scope and remaining holds.

The self-hosted font is pinned as `@fontsource-variable/noto-sans-kr@5.3.0`.
Its original [OFL notice](public/licenses/noto-sans-kr-OFL.txt) is copied to
the static build's `/licenses/noto-sans-kr-OFL.txt`.

## Apply a saved assumption

The economic screen can explicitly select an existing numeric edit slot, confirm
ownership/use/display rights with redistribution denied, register the rights and
a new joint-shock revision, and select that exact revision for calculation.
Knowledge time and applicability must cover the pinned decision/period. The
server still rejects invalid rights, units, conservation and settlement paths.
General baseline/event/settlement authoring is pending. See the
[implementation evidence](../research/web-joint-amendment-implementation.md).

## Monthly cash

After reading a completed economic result, request its monthly cash explicitly.
The [cash API](../contracts/api-economic-cash-flow-v1.md) revalidates the same
job proof, immutable inputs, current read scopes and ledger replay. Amounts
remain exact server decimal strings; unavailable cash stays null/“미확인”.
The table groups months in Asia/Seoul and labels minimum-balance instants as UTC.
It shows at most 12 months per page with manual next/first-page requests and a
keyboard-scrollable region. This is conditional user-assumption arithmetic;
it is not a future margin forecast or farm validation. See the
[cash implementation evidence](../research/web-economic-cash-implementation.md).
